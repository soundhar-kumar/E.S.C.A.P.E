# üõ°Ô∏è Beyond the Firewall: Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model
### *Human-Centric Threat Modeling for the Age of Social Engineering*

---

## üìò Overview
Organizations invest heavily in firewalls, EDR, and SIEM ‚Äî yet **74% of data breaches involve human error**.  
The **Human-E.S.C.A.P.E. Threat Model** reframes cybersecurity by focusing on the *human attack surface* ‚Äî the behaviors, biases, and social vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit.

This framework provides a **GRC-aligned methodology** for identifying, assessing, and mitigating human-centric threats using measurable governance, risk, and compliance controls.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Framework Components (E.S.C.A.P.E)

| Component | Focus | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **E** | Emotional Manipulation | Detects triggers like fear, urgency, or greed used in phishing and scams. |
| **S** | Social Engineering Vectors | Analyzes common attack vectors (phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting). |
| **C** | Cognitive Bias Exploitation | Maps psychological tendencies like authority bias or social proof exploitation. |
| **A** | Authority & Trust Abuse | Examines misuse of authority or impersonation within organizations. |
| **P** | Psychological Pressure | Quantifies compliance pressure under urgency and stress. |
| **E** | Environmental Context | Evaluates external factors like remote work or stress cycles. |

## üìä GRC Alignment Matrix

| GRC Domain | E.S.C.A.P.E. Mapping | Framework Reference |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Governance** | Security policy updates & accountability structures | ISO 27001 A.5 / NIST CSF ‚ÄúIdentify‚Äù |
| **Risk Management** | Human risk scoring & threat modeling | ISO 31000 / NIST RMF Step 3 |
| **Compliance** | Verification & awareness policies | SOC 2 CC7.1 / GDPR Art. 32 |
| **Control Implementation** | Authentication, IAM, training controls | ISO 27001 A.9 & A.12 |
| **Awareness & Culture** | Security champions & gamified awareness | NIST CSF ‚ÄúProtect (PR.AT)‚Äù |
