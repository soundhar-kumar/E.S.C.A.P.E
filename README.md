## üéØ Overview

While organizations invest billions in firewalls, EDR, and SIEM systems, **74% of data breaches involve the human element** (Verizon DBIR 2024). Traditional threat models focus on technical vulnerabilities while ignoring the most exploitable attack surface: **human psychology**.

### The Problem

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| üí∞ **Average Breach Cost** | ‚Çπ40.5 Crore per incident involving human error |
| üìß **Phishing Success Rate** | 32% of employees click malicious links |
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Detection Time** | 287 days average to detect social engineering |
| üìä **Organizations with Human Risk Programs** | Only 23% have formal programs |

### The Solution: Human-E.S.C.A.P.E.

A structured framework providing:
- ‚úÖ **Quantifiable risk assessment** for human vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **Policy and control recommendations** aligned with ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2
- ‚úÖ **Real-world validation** through major breach analysis (Twitter, Uber, MGM)
- ‚úÖ **Practical implementation guidance** for GRC professionals
- ‚úÖ **Proven ROI** with 633% average return on investment

### Framework Highlights

**Each component scores 0-100 based on:**
- Presence of attack indicators
- Control effectiveness
- Environmental risk factors
- Historical incident data

**Weighted Risk Calculation:**
```
Human Risk Score = (E √ó 0.20) + (S √ó 0.25) + (C √ó 0.15) + 
                   (A √ó 0.20) + (P √ó 0.10) + (E √ó 0.10)
```

**Risk Classification:**
- üü¢ 0-29: **LOW** - Monitor and maintain
- üü° 30-49: **MODERATE** - Enhance controls
- üü† 50-69: **HIGH** - Immediate action needed
- üî¥ 70-100: **CRITICAL** - Crisis response required

## üìö Case Studies

### üéØ MGM Resorts Ransomware (September 2023)

**10-minute phone call. ‚Çπ915 Crore loss.**

```
Attack Vector: Help Desk Social Engineering
Duration: 10 minutes
Impact: 9-day operational shutdown
Financial Loss: ‚Çπ915 Crore ($110M)
```

**E.S.C.A.P.E. Analysis:**

| Component | Score | Key Factor |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Emotional | 79/100 | Empathy for "locked out" employee |
| Social Engineering | 91/100 | Professional impersonation |
| Cognitive Bias | 76/100 | Helpfulness bias overrode security |
| Authority | 71/100 | Claimed IT department affiliation |
| Pressure | 84/100 | "Urgent meeting" time constraint |
| Environmental | 82/100 | Help desk culture of quick resolution |
| **OVERALL RISK** | **80.5/100** | **CRITICAL** |

**Control Failures:**
- ‚ùå No multi-factor identity verification
- ‚ùå Password reset without manager approval
- ‚ùå No anomaly detection for privilege escalation
- ‚ùå Weak help desk authentication protocols

**What Would Have Prevented This:**
- ‚úÖ 3-factor identity verification for password resets
- ‚úÖ Callback to registered employee number
- ‚úÖ Manager approval for privileged accounts
- ‚úÖ Monitoring for post-reset anomalous activity

### üéØ Uber Data Breach (September 2022)

**MFA fatigue + WhatsApp impersonation. ‚Çπ1,230 Crore impact.**

```
Attack Method: MFA Fatigue + Fake IT Support
Entry Point: Contractor credentials
Impact: Full network compromise
Financial Loss: ‚Çπ1,230 Crore ($148M in fines)
```

**Attack Chain:**
1. Purchased contractor credentials from dark web
2. Sent 50+ MFA push notifications (fatigue attack)
3. WhatsApp message: "Hi, this is Uber IT. Accept MFA to help us investigate"
4. Contractor clicked "Accept" ‚Üí Full VPN access
5. Found shared admin credentials ‚Üí AWS access
6. Full compromise: Internal systems, source code, customer data

**E.S.C.A.P.E. Score: 82/100 (CRITICAL)**

**Key Lessons:**
- Limit MFA push notifications (max 3/hour)
- Out-of-band verification for IT requests
- Contractor security baseline requirements
- Eliminate shared credentials with PAM solution

---

### üéØ Twitter Breach (July 2020)

**Spear phishing targeting support staff. ‚Çπ2,907 Crore reputational damage.**

```
Attack Vector: Vishing + Credential Harvesting
Accounts Compromised: 130 high-profile (Obama, Biden, Musk)
Direct Loss: ‚Çπ1 Crore ($120K Bitcoin scams)
Reputational Damage: ‚Çπ2,907 Crore ($350M estimated)
```

**E.S.C.A.P.E. Score: 83/100 (CRITICAL)**

**Root Cause:**
- Employees granted admin access without callback verification
- No secondary authentication for high-privilege requests
- Insufficient social engineering awareness training
